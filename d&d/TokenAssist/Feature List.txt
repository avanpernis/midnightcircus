Feature List for TokenAssist application
$Date$ 

Please feel free to add desired or possible features to the To Do list.  If you'd like to work on something, move that item to the In Development list, along with your name so we know who's working on what.  The completed list is there so that we don't try to reinvent the wheel, and so that we all know what TokenAssist is capable of.  If I've forgotten (or don't know about) an already existing feature, please feel free to add it.

7/30/2009 *** The To Do list isn't sorted currently.  Let's just brainstorm possible features right now. ***
